## Final Project


What data I want to vizualize: I've chosen three tables from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (bls.gov). 

  These tables represents data of:
  
    * historical unemployment rates in the US;
    * unemployment rates by state;
    * employment by occupation with median annual wages.

How: using D3.

Layout of the page: 

  the page will be devided into 3 part alike in the Project 2. 
  The top pannel will take 100% of the screen width and will represent the graph of historical                                unemployment rates.
  The bottom of the page will be devided into 2 parts.
  The left part will have the falling down list of all states. When a user chooses certain state, he                          would be able to see the graph of unemployment rates during the last 10 years.
  The right will have the falling down list as well, but this list will contain the areas of occupation.
  When a user chooses the area which he is interested in, he would be able to see the bar grahp that                          reflects the employment rate and median annual wage for that particular area.
  
What is the audience of the vizualization:

  Mainly I want to do that for better understanding of the situation on the labor market in the US, because now the vizualization of that data is very poor. It can be helpful for researches of this realm. Vizualization can accelerate the research, and to that end, will help to lessen the unemployment. Thus, the main audience of the this vizualization is researchers in the area of unemployment in the US.
